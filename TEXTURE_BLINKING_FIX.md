# Texture Blinking Fix

## ðŸŽ¯ **Root Cause: Aggressive Lighting Updates**

The blinking textures were caused by the day/night cycle system updating lighting properties too frequently and aggressively.

### **The Problem:**

1. **updateSkyAndLighting()** was called every frame (60+ times per second)
2. **Abrupt color changes** between day/night phases
3. **Fast day/night cycle** (5 minutes) causing rapid lighting transitions
4. **Jarring HSL jumps** instead of smooth interpolation

### **Fixes Applied:**

#### ðŸ”§ **1. Throttled Lighting Updates**
- Limited lighting updates to once every 100ms instead of every frame
- Prevents constant material property changes
- Reduces GPU stress from frequent shader recompilation

#### ðŸ”§ **2. Slower Day/Night Cycle**
- Increased cycle duration from 5 minutes to 20 minutes
- Changed `dayDuration` from 300 to 1200 seconds
- More gradual environmental transitions

#### ðŸ”§ **3. Smooth Color Interpolation**
- Replaced abrupt `if/else` color switches with `THREE.MathUtils.lerp()`
- **Sun color**: Smooth HSL interpolation based on day phase
- **Fog color**: Gradual transitions instead of hard switches

#### ðŸ”§ **4. GLTF Loading Fix**
- Disabled problematic GLTF model loading temporarily
- Uses reliable procedural character generation
- Eliminates JSON parsing errors

### **Technical Details:**

**Before (Blinking):**
```javascript
// Every frame (60fps)
if (timeOfDay < 0.3) {
  sun.color.setHSL(0.1, 0.8, 0.6) // Orange
} else {
  sun.color.setHSL(0.15, 0.1, 1) // White
}
```

**After (Smooth):**
```javascript
// Every 100ms only
const dayPhase = Math.abs(timeOfDay - 0.5) * 2
const hue = THREE.MathUtils.lerp(0.15, 0.1, dayPhase)
const sat = THREE.MathUtils.lerp(0.1, 0.6, dayPhase)
const light = THREE.MathUtils.lerp(1, 0.7, dayPhase)
sun.color.setHSL(hue, sat, light)
```

### **Expected Results:**

- âœ… **Stable textures** - no more blinking or flickering
- âœ… **Smooth lighting** - gradual day/night transitions
- âœ… **Better performance** - reduced GPU load
- âœ… **Immersive atmosphere** - natural lighting changes
- âœ… **No GLTF errors** - reliable character rendering

The 3D world should now have smooth, stable rendering with beautiful gradual lighting transitions! ðŸŒ…âœ¨
